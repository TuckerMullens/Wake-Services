Literature Interprets the World,2,ENG,150,3,65748,Lamar Wilson,MWF,9:00-9:50,Letter,Open,20,25,2,10,"In this course, we’ll examine novels whose characters, at the crossroads of endurance and necessity, confront mechanisms of external, often oppressive authority while engaging us in stylistically beautiful thought experiments that test our personal moral codes. Together we’ll explore literature’s unique ability to people worlds with compelling, at times tragic protagonists at odds with the dominant culture, or what our will books represent as law, custom and convention."

We’ll have to do this virtually and through large and small Zoom meetings. We will share our close and creative readings, working to understand not only their historical context, but also their relevance to our own lives and times. I have chosen American texts from the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries that seem to be in dialogue with one another. We will wrestle with such issues as identity, race, creativity, love, guilt,  gender, freedom, and autonomy."
Studies in Global Literature,2,ENG,185,3,97869,Jen Buff,MWF,9:00-9:50,Letter,Open,30,35,2,10,"When representing cultures other than the dominant one, many fiction writers ask themselves, “How do I capture the spirit of an oppressed people using the language and literary forms of the oppressor?” Defamiliarizing the form is often the answer. In some works, this deviance is represented as magic, and, in its fascinating presentation, it serves as a powerful reminder that institutions, most certainly including literary ones, must not rely on the status quo; otherwise, the oppression and silencing of minority voices will continue. In this course, we will study this defamiliarization from a variety of cultures in an intriguing, still-evolving, and global genre known as magical realism. We will do so to see how and why it un-homes its readers and gives them the sense that the extraordinary remains possible, even within the context of the ordinary."
Literary Genres,2,ENG,190,3,86954,Erica Stand,MWF,9:00-9:50,Letter,Open,20,30,3,10,"Is Gothic fiction designed simply to frighten us, or does it have a deeper meaning: to encourage us to look beyond the given? In this course, we are intrigued by the various modes of Gothic fiction, how they made their ways to American shores, and what forms they took upon arrival. We will investigate texts that present the Gothic as a form of architecture, as a genre linked to a particular setting (usually dark and brooding), and, perhaps most terrifying, as a state of mind, influenced by personal history, biology, religion, and/or violent capitalist institutions. As we review these different modes, we will consider the influence of earlier Gothic works on later counterparts and how those counterparts changed (or refused to change) the Gothic for new audiences of differing cultures."
